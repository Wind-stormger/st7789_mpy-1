# ST7789 Driver for MicroPython

This driver is based on [devbis' st7789_mpy driver.](https://github.com/devbis/st7789_mpy)
I modified the original driver for one of my projects to add:

- Display Rotation.
- Scrolling
- Writing text using bitmaps converted from True Type fonts
- Drawing text using 8 and 16 bit wide bitmap fonts
- Drawing text using Hershey vector fonts
- Drawing JPG's, including a SLOW mode to draw jpg's larger than available ram
  using the TJpgDec - Tiny JPEG Decompressor R0.01d. from
  http://elm-chan.org/fsw/tjpgd/00index.html
- Drawing and rotating Polygons and filled Polygons.
- Tracking bounds
- Support for st7735 displays

Included are 12 bitmap fonts derived from classic pc text mode fonts, 26
Hershey vector fonts and several example programs for different devices.

## Display Configuration

Some displays may use a BGR color order or iverted colors. The `cfg_helper.py` program can use used to determine the color order, inversion_mode, colstart, and rowstart values needed for a display.

### Color Modes

You can test the color order needed by a display by filling the display with the `st7789.RED` color and observing the color displayed.
  - If the display is RED, the settings are correct.
  - If the display is BLUE, `color_order` should be `st7789.BGR`.
  - If the display is YELLOW, `inversion_mode` should be `True`.
  - If the display is CYAN, `color_order` should be `st7789.BGR` and `inversion_mode` should be `True`.

### colstart and rowstart

Some displays have a frame buffer memory larger than the physical LCD or LED matrix. In these cases the driver must be configured with the position of the first physcial column and row pixels relative to the frame buffer.  Each rotation setting of the display may require different colstart and rowstart values.

The driver automatically adjusts the colstart and rowstarts values for common 135x240, 240x240 and
240x320 displays. These values can be overridden using the `offsets` method if the default values do not work for your display. The `offsets` method  should be called after any calls of the `rotation` method.

#### 128x128 st7735 cfg_helper.py example

```
inversion_mode(False)
color_order = st7789.BGR
for rotation 0 use offset(2, 1)
for rotation 1 use offset(1, 2)
for rotation 2 use offset(2, 3)
for rotation 3 use offset(3, 2)
```

#### 128x160 st7735 cfg_helper.py example

```
inversion_mode(False)
color_order = st7789.RGB
for rotation 0 use offset(0, 0)
for rotation 1 use offset(0, 0)
for rotation 2 use offset(0, 0)
for rotation 3 use offset(0, 0)
```

## Pre-compiled firmware files

The firmware directory contains pre-compiled firmware for various devices with
the st7789 C driver and frozen python font files. See the README.md file in the
fonts folder for more information on the font files.

## Overview

This is a driver for MicroPython to handle cheap displays based on the ST7789
chip.

</p>

The driver is written in C. Firmware is provided for ESP32, ESP32 with SPIRAM,
pyboard1.1, and Raspberry Pi Pico devices.


# Setup MicroPython Build Environment in Ubuntu 20.04.2

See the MicroPython [README.md](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/ports/esp32/README.md#setting-up-esp-idf-and-the-build-environment) if you run into any build issues not directly related to the st7789 driver. The recommended MicroPython build instructions may have changed. 

Update and upgrade Ubuntu using apt-get if you are using a new install of Ubuntu or the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

```bash
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade
```

Use apt-get to install the required build tools.

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install build-essential libffi-dev git pkg-config cmake virtualenv python3-pip python3-virtualenv
```

### Install a compatible esp-idf SDK

The MicroPython README.md states: "The ESP-IDF changes quickly and MicroPython only supports certain versions. Currently MicroPython supports v4.0.2, v4.1.1 and v4.2, although other IDF v4 versions may also work."  I have had good luck using IDF v4.2.

Clone the esp-idf SDK repo -- this usually takes several minutes

```bash
git clone -b v4.2 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
cd esp-idf/
git pull
```

If you already have a copy of the IDF you can checkout a version compatible with MicroPython and update the submodules using:

```bash
$ cd esp-idf
$ git checkout v4.2
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Install the esp-idf SDK.

```bash
./install.sh
```

Source the esp-idf export.sh script to set the required environment variables. It's important that you source the file and not run it using ./export.sh. You will need to source this file before compiling MicroPython.

```bash
source export.sh
cd ..
```

Clone the MicroPython repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/micropython/micropython.git
```

Clone the st7789 driver repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/russhughes/st7789_mpy.git
```

Update the git submodules and compile the micropython cross-compiler

```bash
cd micropython/
git submodule update --init
cd mpy-cross/
make
cd ..
cd ports/esp32
```

Copy any .py files you want to include in the firmware as frozen python modules to the modules subdirectory in ports/esp32. Be aware there is a limit to the flash space available. You will know you have exceeded this limit if you receive an error message saying the code won't fit in the partition or if your firmware continuously reboots with an error.

For example:

```bash
cp ../../../st7789_mpy/fonts/bitmap/vga1_16x16.py modules
cp ../../../st7789_mpy/fonts/truetype/NotoSans_32.py modules
cp ../../../st7789_mpy/fonts/vector/scripts.py modules
```

Build the MicroPython firmware with the driver and frozen .py files in the modules directory. If you did not add any .py files to the modules directory you can leave out the FROZEN_MANIFEST and FROZEN_MPY_DIR settings.

```bash
make USER_C_MODULES=../../../../st7789_mpy/st7789/micropython.cmake FROZEN_MANIFEST="" FROZEN_MPY_DIR=$UPYDIR/modules
```

Erase and flash the firmware to your device. Set PORT= to the ESP32's usb serial port. I could not get the usb serial port to work under the Windows Subsystem (WSL2) for Linux. If you have the same issue you can copy the firmware.bin file and use the Windows esptool.py to flash your device.

```bash
make USER_C_MODULES=../../../../st7789_mpy/st7789/micropython.cmake PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0 erase
make USER_C_MODULES=../../../../st7789_mpy/st7789/micropython.cmake PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0 deploy
```

The firmware.bin file will be in the build-GENERIC directory. To flash using the python esptool.py utility. Use pip3 to install the esptool if it's not already installed.

```bash
pip3 install esptool
```

Set PORT= to the ESP32's usb serial port

```bash
esptool.py --port COM3 erase_flash
esptool.py --chip esp32 --port COM3 write_flash -z 0x1000 firmware.bin
```
## CMake building instructions for MicroPython 1.14 and later

for ESP32:

    $ cd micropython/ports/esp32

And then compile the module with specified USER_C_MODULES dir

    $ make USER_C_MODULES=../../../../st7789_mpy/st7789/micropython.cmake

for Raspberry Pi PICO:

    $ cd micropython/ports/rp2

And then compile the module with specified USER_C_MODULES dir

    $ make USER_C_MODULES=../../../st7789_mpy/st7789/micropython.cmake

## Working examples

This module was tested on ESP32, STM32 based pyboard v1.1 and the Raspberry Pi
Pico. You have to provide a `SPI` object and the pin to use for the `dc' input of the screen.


    # ESP32

    import machine
    import st7789
    spi = machine.SPI(2, baudrate=40000000, polarity=1, sck=machine.Pin(18), mosi=machine.Pin(23))
    display = st7789.ST7789(spi, 240, 240, reset=machine.Pin(4, machine.Pin.OUT), dc=machine.Pin(2, machine.Pin.OUT))
    display.init()


I was not able to run the display with a baud rate over 40MHZ.

## Methods

- `st7789.ST7789(spi, width, height, dc, reset, cs, backlight, rotation, color_order, inversion_mode, buffer_size)`

    ### Required positional arguments:
    - `spi` spi device
    - `width` display width
    - `height` display height
    ### Required keyword arguments:
    - `dc` sets the pin connected to the display data/command selection input. This parameter is always required.

    ### Optional keyword arguments:

    - `reset` sets the pin connected to the displays hardware reset input. If the displays reset pin is tied high the `reset` parameter is not required.

    - `cs` sets the pin connected to the displays chip select input. If the displays CS pin is tied low, the display must be the only device connected to the SPI port. The display will always be the selected device and the `cs` parameter is not required.

    - `backlight` sets the pin connected to the displays backlight enable input. The displays backlight input can often be left floating or disconnected as the backlight on some displays are always powered on and cannot be turned off.

    - `rotation` 0-0 degrees, 1-90 degrees, 2-180 degrees, 3-270 degrees

    - `color_order` set the color order used by the driver st7789.RGB and st7789.BGR are supported.

    - `inversion` Sets the display color inversion mode if True, clears the display color inversion mode if false.

    - `buffer_size` If a buffer_size is not specified a dynamically allocated buffer is created and freed as needed. If a buffer_size is specified it must be large enough to contain the largest bitmap, font character and/or decoded JPG image used (Rows * Columns * 2 bytes, 16bit colors in RGB565 notation). Dynamic allocation is slower and can cause heap fragmentation so garbage collection (GC) should be enabled.

- `inversion_mode(bool)` Sets the display color inversion mode if True,
   clears the display color inversion mode if false.

- `madctl(value)` Returns the current value of the MADCTL register.
   Optionally sets the MADCTL register if a value is passed to the method.

  Constant Name    | Value | Description
  ---------------- | ----- | ----------------------
  st7789.MADCTL_MY | 0x80  | Page Address Order
  st7789_MADCTL_MX | 0x40  | Column Address Order
  st7789_MADCTL_MV | 0x20  | Page/Column Order
  st7789_MADCTL_ML | 0x10  | Line Address Order
  st7789_MADCTL_MH | 0x04  | Display Data Latch Order
  st7789_RGB       | 0x00  | RGB color order
  st7789_BGR       | 0x08  | BGR color order

- `on()`

  Turn on the backlight pin if one was defined during init.

- `off()`

  Turn off the backlight pin if one was defined during init.

- `pixel(x, y, color)`

  Set the specified pixel to the given `color`.

- `line(x0, y0, x1, y1, color)`

  Draws a single line with the provided `color` from (`x0`, `y0`) to
  (`x1`, `y1`).

- `hline(x, y, length, color)`

  Draws a single horizontal line with the provided `color` and `length`
  in pixels. Along with `vline`, this is a fast version with reduced
  number of SPI calls.

- `vline(x, y, length, color)`

  Draws a single horizontal line with the provided `color` and `length`
  in pixels.

- `rect(x, y, width, height, color)`

  Draws a rectangle from (`x`, `y`) with corresponding dimensions

- `fill_rect(x, y, width, height, color)`

  Fill a rectangle starting from (`x`, `y`) coordinates

- `circle(x, y, r, color)`

  Draws a circle with radius `r` centered at the (`x`, `y`) coordinates in the given
  `color`.

- `fill_circle(x, y, r, color)`

  Draws a filled circle with radius `r` centered at the (`x`, `y`) coordinates in the given `color`.

- `blit_buffer(buffer, x, y, width, height)`

  Copy bytes() or bytearray() content to the screen internal memory.
  Note: every color requires 2 bytes in the array

- `text(font, s, x, y[, fg, bg])`

  Write text to the display using the specified bitmap `font` with the
  coordinates as the upper-left corner of the text. The foreground and
  background colors of the text can be set by the optional arguments `fg` and
  `bg`, otherwise the foreground color defaults to `WHITE` and the background
  color defaults to `BLACK`.  See the `README.md` in the `fonts/bitmap`
  directory for example fonts.

- `write(bitmap_font, s, x, y[, fg, bg, background_tuple, fill_flag])`

  Write text to the display using the specified proportional or Monospace bitmap
  font module with the coordinates as the upper-left corner of the text. The
  foreground and background colors of the text can be set by the optional
  arguments `fg` and `bg`, otherwise the foreground color defaults to `WHITE`
  and the background color defaults to `BLACK`.

  Transparency can be emulated by providing a `background_tuple` containing
  (bitmap_buffer, width, height).  This is the same format used by the jpg_decode
  method. See examples/T-DISPLAY/clock/clock.py for an example.

  See the `README.md` in the `truetype/fonts` directory for example fonts.
  Returns the width of the string as printed in pixels. Accepts UTF8 encoded strings.

  The `font2bitmap` utility creates compatible 1 bit per pixel bitmap modules
  from Proportional or Monospaced True Type fonts. The character size,
  foreground, background colors and the characters to include in the bitmap
  module may be specified as parameters. Use the -h option for details. If you
  specify a buffer_size during the display initialization it must be large
  enough to hold the widest character (HEIGHT * MAX_WIDTH * 2).

- `write_len(bitap_font, s)`

  Returns the width of the string in pixels if printed in the specified font.

- `draw(vector_font, s, x, y[, fg, scale])`

  Draw text to the display using the specified hershey vector font with the
  coordinates as the lower-left corner of the text. The foreground color of the
  text can be set by the optional argument `fg`, otherwise the foreground color
  defaults to `WHITE`. The size of the text can be scaled by specifying a
  `scale` value. The `scale` value must be larger then 0 and can be a floating
  point or an integer value. The `scale` value defaults to 1.0. See the
  README.md in the `vector/fonts` directory for example fonts and the utils
  directory for a font conversion program.

- `jpg(jpg_filename, x, y [, method])`

  Draw JPG file on the display at the given `x` and `y` coordinates as the upper
  left corner of the image. There memory required to decode and display a JPG
  can be considerable as a full screen 320x240 JPG would require at least 3100
  bytes for the working area + 320 * 240 * 2 bytes of ram to buffer the image.
  Jpg images that would require a buffer larger than available memory can be drawn
  by passing `SLOW` for method. The `SLOW` method will draw the image a piece
  at a time using the Minimum Coded Unit (MCU, typically a multiple of 8x8)
  of the image.

- `jpg_decode(jpg_filename [, x, y, width, height])`

  Decode a jpg file and return it or a portion of it as a tuple composed of
  (buffer, width, height). The buffer is a color565 blit_buffer compatible byte
  array. The buffer will require width * height * 2 bytes of memory.

  If the optional x, y, width and height parameters are given the buffer will
  only contain the specified area of the image. See examples/T-DISPLAY/clock/clock.py
  examples/T-DISPLAY/toasters_jpg/toasters_jpg.py for examples.

- `polygon_center(polygon)`

   Return the center of the `polygon` as an (x, y) tuple. The `polygon` should
   consist of a list of (x, y) tuples forming a closed convex polygon.

- `fill_polygon(polygon, x, y, color[, angle, center_x, center_y])`

  Draw a filled `polygon` at the `x`, `y` coordinates in the `color` given.
  The polygon may be rotated `angle` radians about the `center_x` and
  `center_y` point. The polygon should consist of a list of (x, y) tuples
  forming a closed convex polygon.

  See the TWATCH-2020 `watch.py` demo for an example.

- `polygon(polygon, x, y, color, angle, center_x, center_y)`

  Draw a `polygon` at the `x`, `y` coordinates in the `color` given. The polygon
  may be rotated `angle` radians a bout the `center_x` and `center_y` point.
  The polygon should consist of a list of (x, y) tuples forming a closed
  convex polygon.

  See the T-Display `roids.py` for an example.

- `bounding([status])`

  Bounding turns on and off tracking the area of the display that has been
  written to. Initially tracking is disabled, pass a True value to enable
  tracking and False to disable. Passing a True or False parameter will reset
  the current bounding rectangle to (display_width, display_height, 0, 0).

  Returns a four integer tuple containing (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y) indicating
  the area of the display that has been written to since the last clearing.

  See the TWATCH-2020 `watch.py` demo for an example.

- `bitmap(bitmap, x , y [, index])`

  Draw `bitmap` using the specified `x`, `y` coordinates as the upper-left
  corner of the of the `bitmap`. The optional `index` parameter provides a
  method to select from multiple bitmaps contained a `bitmap` module. The
  `index` is used to calculate the offset to the beginning of the desired bitmap
  using the modules HEIGHT, WIDTH and BPP values.

  The `imgtobitmap.py` utility creates compatible 1 to 8 bit per pixel bitmap modules
  from image files using the Pillow Python Imaging Library.

  The `monofont2bitmap.py` utility creates compatible 1 to 8 bit per pixel
  bitmap modules from Monospaced True Type fonts. See the `inconsolata_16.py`,
  `inconsolata_32.py` and `inconsolata_64.py` files in the `examples/lib` folder
  for sample modules and the `mono_font.py` program for an example using the
  generated modules.

  The character sizes, bit per pixel, foreground, background
  colors and the characters to include in the bitmap module may be specified as
  parameters. Use the -h option for details. Bits per pixel settings larger than
  one may be used to create antialiased characters at the expense of memory use.
  If you specify a buffer_size during the display initialization it must be
  large enough to hold the one character (HEIGHT * WIDTH * 2).

- `width()`

  Returns the current logical width of the display. (ie a 135x240 display
  rotated 90 degrees is 240 pixels wide)

- `height()`

  Returns the current logical height of the display. (ie a 135x240 display
  rotated 90 degrees is 135 pixels high)

- `rotation(r)`

  Set the rotates the logical display in a clockwise direction. 0-Portrait
  (0 degrees), 1-Landscape (90 degrees), 2-Inverse Portrait (180 degrees),
  3-Inverse Landscape (270 degrees)

- `offset(x_start, y_start)` The memory in the ST7789 controller is
  configured for a 240x320 display. When using a smaller display like a
  240x240 or 135x240 an offset needs to added to the x and y parameters so
  that the pixels are written to the memory area that corresponds to the
  visible display.  The offsets may need to be adjusted when rotating the
  display.

  For example the TTGO-TDisplay is 135x240 and uses the following offsets.
  | Rotation | x_start | y_start |
  |----------|---------|---------|
  | 0        | 52      | 40      |
  | 1        | 40      | 53      |
  | 2        | 53      | 40      |
  | 3        | 40      | 52      |

  When the rotation method is called the driver will adjust the offsets for a
  135x240 or 240x240 display. Your display may require using different offset
  values, if so, use the `offset` method after `rotation` to set the offset
  values.

  The values needed for particular display may not be documented and may
  require some experimentation to determine the correct values. One technique
  is to draw a box the same size as the display and then make small changes
  to the offsets until the display looks correct. See the `cfg_helper.py` program
  in the examples folder for more information.


The module exposes predefined colors:
  `BLACK`, `BLUE`, `RED`, `GREEN`, `CYAN`, `MAGENTA`, `YELLOW`, and `WHITE`


## Helper functions

- `color565(r, g, b)`

  Pack a color into 2-bytes rgb565 format

- `map_bitarray_to_rgb565(bitarray, buffer, width, color=WHITE, bg_color=BLACK)`

  Convert a `bitarray` to the rgb565 color `buffer` that is suitable for blitting.
  Bit 1 in `bitarray` is a pixel with `color` and 0 - with `bg_color`.

  This is a helper with a good performance to print text with a high
  resolution font. You can use an awesome tool
  https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-font-to-py
  to generate a bitmap fonts from .ttf and use them as a frozen bytecode from
  the ROM memory.
